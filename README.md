# Classic Snake Game 

This project is a recreation of the classic Snake Game, similar to the one found on old Nokia phones, developed using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, aiming to eat food items that appear at random positions. Every time the snake consumes food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases.

The game continues until the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries, at which point the game ends.


## Features

- **Smooth Controls:** The snake's movement can be controlled using the arrow keys for an intuitive and responsive gameplay experience.
- **Random Food Generation:** The food appears at random locations on the screen, adding a dynamic challenge to the gameplay.
- **Score Tracking:** The player's score increases as the snake grows with each food item eaten, encouraging higher scores.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the screen, just like in the original version.
- **Cheat Code:** Pressing ctrl increases the score directly. ðŸ¤«
